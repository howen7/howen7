# Hi There!

Thanks for visiting my page.

Check out some of the pinned repos below to see the projects I've worked on. 
From them you will find that data can help you....

1. Classify stages of Alzheimers.
2. Predict how much your house will sell for
3. Help determine the best zipcode to invest real estate in
4. Determine when a customer will likely leave a company


Right now I'm using Flask to implement my convolutional neural network to a web application. 

### About me

I graduated Iowa State with a Bachelors in Aerospace Engineering in 2017 and then worked at Collins Aerospace as a contractor up until August 2020. I joined Flatiron’s Computer Science Program in August and absolutely loved it. When I’m not doing data science projects I like to travel and read. Thailand has been my favorite place, partly because the food (Khao Soi and Curry’s), but also the rich culture and the geography. I highly recommend going to Chiang Mai and the Southern Islands. As far as books, I mostly consume science fiction and fantasy; some of my favorites include Hyperion, Childhoods End, and the First Law series.
